\Large\textbf{Nowcasting Korean Macroeconomic Variables: A Comparison of ARIMA, VAR, DFM, and DDFM Models}
\end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

\begin{abstract}
This study compares the performance of four forecasting models (ARIMA, VAR, Dynamic Factor Model, and Deep Dynamic Factor Model) for nowcasting three key Korean macroeconomic variables: production (Industrial Production Index, All Industries: KOIPALL.G), investment (Equipment Investment Index: KOEQUIPTE), and consumption (Wholesale and Retail Trade Sales: KOWRCCNSE). Models are evaluated across three forecast horizons (1, 7, and 28 days) using standardized metrics to enable fair comparison across different series scales. The results will be presented based on experimental evaluation of model performance across targets and horizons.
