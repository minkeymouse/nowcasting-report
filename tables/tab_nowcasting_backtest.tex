\caption[Nowcasting Backtest Results by Model-Timepoint and Target-Metric]{Nowcasting Backtest Results by Model-Timepoint and Target-Metric\footnote{Train with data from 1985 to 2019, nowcast from Jan 2024 to Oct 2025 (22 months). For each target month, perform nowcasting at multiple time points (4 weeks before, 1 week before month end). By masking unavailable data based on release dates, generate 1 horizon forecast at each time point. Calculate sMSE, sMAE for each month and time point, then average across 22 months.}}
